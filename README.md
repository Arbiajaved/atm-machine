ATM Machine – Full Stack Project

A simple ATM Machine Simulation built with Java (backend) and HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend). This project mimics core ATM operations such as account login, balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and transaction history.

🚀 Features
User Authentication: Secure login for customers.
Balance Inquiry: View current account balance.
Cash Withdrawal & Deposit: Simulate withdrawing and depositing money.
Transaction History: Track and display recent transactions.
Responsive UI: Clean and simple interface built with HTML/CSS.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Java (atm.java)
Database (optional): Can be integrated with SQL for real storage

📂 Project Structure
ATM-Machine/
│── atm.java        # Java backend logic
│── index.html      # Frontend UI
│── style.css       # Styling
│── script.js       # Client-side interactions
│── README.md       # Project documentation

⚙️ How It Works
Log in with a valid account number/PIN (demo credentials can be hardcoded).
Choose an operation (Balance Inquiry, Withdraw, Deposit, History).
Perform the transaction – Java handles the logic; frontend updates dynamically.
View transaction history at any time.

🖥️ How to Run Locally
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/atm-machine.git
cd atm-machine
Run atm.java in any Java IDE (NetBeans/IntelliJ/Eclipse) or command line.
Open index.html in a browser to access the UI.
Could you make sure the Java backend is running to process operations?

🔮 Future Enhancements
Integrate with SQL database for persistent account storage.
Add an admin panel to manage users/accounts.
Add encryption & security features to protect user data.
